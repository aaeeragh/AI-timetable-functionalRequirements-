# Automatic Timetable Generation System

Welcome to the **Automatic Timetable Generation System** repository! This project leverages **Artificial Intelligence** to automate the creation of conflict-free academic timetables, ensuring efficient scheduling for students, professors, and classrooms.

---

## 📝 **Project Overview**

The system aims to replace traditional manual timetable creation by implementing AI-based algorithms to solve scheduling conflicts and optimize resource allocation.

### **Key Features**
- **Automated Scheduling:** AI ensures no scheduling conflicts between classes, professors, or rooms.
- **Input Constraints:** Incorporates availability constraints for staff and rooms.
- **Real-Time Review & Edit:** Administrators can review and make manual adjustments to the generated timetable.
- **Publication:** Final timetables can be published for access by students and faculty.
